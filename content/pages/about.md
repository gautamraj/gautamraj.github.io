I'm currently working as a software engineer at Stripe. I'm interested in distributed systems, reliability, and performance at scale. I've been fortunate to work in this space for the past several years, and my goal in writing here is to share some of the things I've learned. Feel free to reach out if you have feedback or would like to connect!
